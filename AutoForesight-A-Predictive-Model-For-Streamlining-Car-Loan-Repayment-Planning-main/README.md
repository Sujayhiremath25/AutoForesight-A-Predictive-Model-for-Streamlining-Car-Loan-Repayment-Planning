# AutoForesight - A Predictive Model For Streamlining Car Loan Repayment Planning

Vehicle loan repayment prediction refers to the process of predicting whether or not a borrower will default on their vehicle loan. Default occurs when the borrower is unable or unwilling to repay the loan amount as agreed with the lender, leading to financial losses for the lender. The prediction is based on various factors related to the borrower and the loan itself. Some of the key factors that can affect loan repayment include:
Income: The borrower's income is a key factor in determining their ability to repay the loan. Higher income levels are associated with a lower risk of default.
